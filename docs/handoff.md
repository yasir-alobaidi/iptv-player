# Handoff — 2026-09-23 (Phase 4 step 3 built)

For the next Claude Code session on this project, and for the user starting it.

## Before you start the next session (user)
**1. Review step 3 and push it.** Everything is committed locally
("Phase 4 step 3: the XMLTV parser and the import isolate").

**2. CI was red on your step 2 push, on both systems.**
- **Linux (4 failures): found and fixed in this commit.** Phase 3's
  goldens print clock times in the machine's zone. They were recorded here
  in New York time, and the runner is on UTC. They now pass under UTC, New
  York and Tokyo, and no image was re-recorded.
- **Windows (3 failures): not diagnosed.** The same 3 failed at the Phase 2
  exit, when the job also hit its 45-minute limit. GitHub only shows job
  logs to repo admins, so I can't read them. Please open run 35494753305 →
  Windows → "Test (Windows, goldens excluded)" and paste the names of the
  failing tests into the next session.

## Start prompt
Open Claude Code in this folder and paste:

```
Continue the IPTV player project. Read docs/handoff.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/progress.md,
docs/plans/phase-4-epg-and-guide.md and ADR-011 in docs/decisions.md first.
Step 3 is reviewed and pushed; CI is <green | red: …>. Windows failures: <names, or "not checked">.
Do Phase 4 step 4 (matching, and now/next everywhere) and stop for my review.
```

## Where things stand
- **Phases 1–3 are built; Phase 4 has steps 1–3 of 7.** The fake panel
  serves a guide (step 1). Schema v5 stores it, with staging and an atomic
  swap (step 2). Step 3 adds the XMLTV parser and the import isolate.
- **The parser:** 300 MB in 4.3 s, +23 MB RSS. The time for the full
  300 MB import (batch writes and the swap) is still to measure, in step 7.
- **Nothing in the app starts an import yet**, and nothing shows the guide.
  `EpgImporter` exists but is not wired to Riverpod or `bootstrap()`. The
  scheduler is step 7, now/next is step 4, and the grid is step 6.
- All checks clean: analyze, format, **1,174 app tests** (4 skipped
  benchmarks) under `TZ=UTC`, the fake provider's 114, and the app-launch
  and sources-keyboard integration tests under xvfb (the sync now runs
  guarded). The other integration tests (the fault suite, the Live TV
  walk, the engine) were not rerun: nothing they drive changed.

## Done this session (2026-09-23)
- Phase 4 step 3, built by three parallel agents working from one written
  behaviour spec:
  - the parser (`lib/data/providers/xmltv/`);
  - the import pipeline (`xmltv_reader.dart`, `lib/data/sync/epg_import_work.dart`,
    `epg_importer.dart`);
  - fixture tests (`test_fixtures/xmltv/`, 29 files), written from the spec
    rather than from the parser's output.
- The fixture tests caught one disagreement: entities are now decoded twice,
  as XML and then by `cleanText`, so a guide's channel names match the
  Xtream client's.
- The end-to-end tests caught the fake panel's HD/SD pairs sharing one guide
  id with two schedules. That led to the `out_of_order` rule: the first
  schedule wins.
- CI: the golden time-zone fix above, and `goldenNow()`.
- **A deadlock, found by a flaky test and fixed at the root.** Cancelling a
  job that writes (the import, and the Phase 2 sync too) could kill its
  isolate between a batch's begin and its commit. drift never rolls back a
  dead client's transaction, so every query in the app then waited for
  good. Writing isolates now use `startGuardedJob` + `openJobDatabase` and
  are only killed between transactions (ADR-011 step 3, with a regression
  test that deadlocks under the old kill).

## Instructions for the next session
1. **Check CI first** (`curl` on the Actions API, see memory). Run the
   full suite with **`TZ=UTC flutter test`**, since CI runs in UTC and this
   laptop does not.
2. **Phase 4 step 4 is next** (the plan's section): `EpgMatcher` in docs/02's
   order, filling `epg_matches` (`EpgDao.replaceMatches`), `DbGuide` from the
   imported guide and `CompositeGuide` in front of `ShortEpgGuide` (decision
   1), and "No guide information" for an unmatched channel. The matcher's
   name rule should use the same cleaning as the names it compares:
   XMLTV display names already went through `cleanText`.
1a. **Any isolate that writes to the database starts with
   `startGuardedJob` and connects with `openJobDatabase`**, never
   `startBackgroundJob` + `connection.connect()`: a kill inside a drift
   batch leaves its transaction open and blocks the whole database.
2a. **The EPG pipeline (step 3):**
   - `parseXmltv` is the parser's only API; the rules are in ADR-011
     step 3, and the skip codes in `XmltvSkip` are stored, never renamed.
   - `EpgImporter.importGuide(sourceId)` resolves the guide (override →
     `xmltv.php` → the playlist's `url-tvg`) and runs `runEpgImportWork` in
     an isolate. That isolate writes **single batches only**.
   - The importer then swaps the rows in, or abandons the import and sweeps.
   - A guide URL is hidden from everything the isolate returns
     (`hideUrl` / `failureWithoutUrl` in `xmltv_reader.dart`); use them for
     anything new that can print a guide URL.
   - Tests start the fake provider in-process (`epg_importer_test.dart`
     shows how, with `xmltv.php`'s query flags on an EPG override URL).
3. **With the user's yes only:** one guide import from their real panel (no
   stream, so no connection is used), to see its real shape before step 5.
3a. **Before a release: the 8-hour soak** (`tools/soak/run.sh 480`), and
   the cast relay (Phase 7) must own its sockets as the fake provider's does
   (ADR-010 "The soak run").
4. **Phase 3 (playback):** `PlayerEngine` (`lib/core/player/`) is the seam;
   `MediaKitPlayerEngine` (`lib/data/player_mediakit/`) passes
   `waitForInitialization: false` on its own property calls (media_kit
   otherwise waits for the video controller's first texture, which needs
   frames drawn) and sets `vid=auto` when headless. `PlaybackCoordinator`
   (`lib/features/playback/domain/`) owns playback, the connection policy
   and the watchdog; `HttpStreamProber` classifies failures;
   `playbackCoordinatorProvider`, `playbackStateProvider`,
   `playbackSettingsControllerProvider`. Live TV in
   `lib/features/live_tv/`; the player at `/player`
   (`PlayerScreen`, root navigator). Integration tests that play need
   `binding.framePolicy = fullyLive` and the samples
   (`streamsAvailable`); `IPTV_PLAYER_VIDEO=0` plays with no picture.
   **Never play from the user's provider without asking first** (a pop-up;
   they free their one connection and say yes).
1j. **Step 8:** keyboard helpers for integration tests live in
   `integration_test/support/keyboard.dart` (`Keys`, finders). They send
   explicit physical keys (profile builds have no key debug names) and
   `resume()` clears held keys (the real desktop reports its modifiers).
   A long list is one Tab stop with `FocusPane(tabStop: true)`. Frame
   times: `flutter drive --profile -d linux
   --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart
   --target=integration_test/large_sync_test.dart`; the Linux embedder
   reports raster time as 0. An empty 404 from the panel is an
   `AuthFailure`; a scripted test server that means "not found" must
   send a body.
1i. **Step 7 (Settings):** `SettingsScreen` + `settingsLocationProvider`
   (section, and the source the Categories section manages); open it from
   anywhere with `openSettings()`. Pages in
   `lib/features/sources/presentation/`: `SourcesSettings`,
   `CategoriesManager`, `source_text.dart` (every phrase about a source's
   state), `current_source.dart` (`chosenSourceIdProvider`,
   `currentSourceProvider` — what the catalogue screens of Phase 3+
   should browse), `source_shell_slots.dart` (`sourceShellOverrides`,
   applied in `bootstrap()`; an integration test must apply them too).
   Edit is `ConnectScreen(editSourceId:)` at `editSourcePath(id)`.
   `onboardingReturnPathProvider` makes adding from Settings end there.
   Remove a source only through `SyncService.removeSource()`, then
   `chosenSourceIdProvider.notifier.forget(id)`.
   **Show menus and dialogs with `showAppMenu` / `showAppDialog`**; Esc
   closes them through the global Esc action. A callback a provider builds
   must not use its `ref` later: read the notifiers first (see
   `source_shell_slots.dart`).
   **Integration tests under xvfb:** register `tester.testTextInput`,
   ignore the engine's lifecycle and view-focus events (there is no window
   manager, so the window flips between focused and not and Flutter parks
   keyboard focus), and send Enter in a text field as
   `receiveAction(TextInputAction.done)`, as the platform's text input
   does. **One file per `flutter test` run** on Linux desktop.
1h. **Onboarding (step 6):** screens in `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/`;
   the domain they use in `lib/features/sources/domain/` (`SourceChecker`,
   `CategoryRepository`, `validateDraft`, `groupCategories`). The app opens on
   Welcome when the sources table is empty (`startLocationProvider`, set in
   `bootstrap()`). Widget tests run against the fakes in
   `test/features/onboarding/onboarding_fakes.dart`; **a future a fake hands
   out must be made inside the test body**, not in `setUp`, or the fake clock
   never delivers it. `focusIsOn(tester, finder)` there checks keyboard focus.
   Set text weights with `TextStyle.withWeight()`, never
   `copyWith(fontWeight:)` alone (it doesn't change a variable font's weight;
   older components still do it, see Known issues). `layering_test.dart`
   fails when presentation or design code imports drift, dio, media_kit,
   sqlite3, `dart:io`, `dart:isolate` or `lib/data/`.
1g. **The sync engine (step 5):** the sync isolate writes **only single
   batches, never a longer transaction** — a killed isolate's open
   transaction blocks the database for everyone (spiked), and since
   Phase 4 step 3 it is stopped with `startGuardedJob`, so it is never
   killed inside a batch either. Start and finish happen on
   the UI isolate; the finish is one transaction. `openAppDatabase` must
   stay a `createBackgroundConnection` (not a `LazyDatabase`), or sync
   writes go through a proxy on the UI isolate; `app_database_open_test`
   guards it. A closure sent to an isolate must be built in a top-level
   function (`startSyncJob`), or it drags its enclosing scope along.
   `removeSource()` stops a sync before removing its source; an empty Xtream
   list is swept only when the previous successful run had it empty too
   (`counts_json` `"empty"`). The kill test needs `dart` on PATH and is skipped on Windows.
1f. **M3U (step 4):** credentials in stream URLs are `{username}`,
   `{password}`, `{token}` placeholders; `fillUrl(template,
   playlistSecrets(realPlaylistUrl))` rebuilds the real URL at play time
   (Phase 3). The identity hash is pinned in tests: never change
   `entryIdentity`. Test fixtures are byte-exact (`.gitattributes`).
   Timing checks go in a test tagged `benchmark`, which is skipped unless
   run with `--tags benchmark --run-skipped`.
1c. **The Xtream client (step 3):** get credentials only through
   `SourceRepository.credentialsFor()`, and never keep `SourceCredentials`
   in a long-lived object. `XtreamAccount.toStoredJson()` is an allow-list
   and already free of the echoed username and password, so store exactly
   that in `account_json`. In step 5 the client runs **inside** the sync
   isolate. **Don't set dio's `receiveTimeout`** anywhere: it replaces a
   Timer per chunk and froze the UI isolate for ~1 s on 50k rows; the
   client's own idle watchdog (`idleTimeout`) replaces it.
1d. **Tests that talk to a real server** (the fake provider in-process, or
   a scripted `HttpServer`) need `setUpAll(() => HttpOverrides.global =
   null)`: flutter_test's binding otherwise answers every request with a
   400. **Timing and jank measurements need the fake provider in its own
   process** (`dart run tools/fake_provider/bin/server.dart --profile large
   --port …`): in-process, its JSON encoding shows up as the client's jank.
   To test a connection dropped mid-body, use a raw `ServerSocket`;
   `HttpServer.detachSocket()` leaves it open.
1e. **Write invisible characters as escapes** (`'\ufeff'`, `'\ufffd'`,
   `\u00a0`). The file-writing tool turned escapes into the literal
   characters more than once this session; grep for them before
   committing.
1a. **Secrets (step 2):** the keyring holds one JSON document per source
   under `source.<id>`; the database never holds a password, and holds
   playlist and EPG URLs as their origin only (`displayOrigin()`), because
   `redact()` can't see a token in a path. `InMemoryCredentialStore` (with
   `locked = true` to simulate a locked keyring) is the store for every
   test and CI; there is no keyring there. The hard-rule-3 test in
   `test/features/sources/data/db_source_repository_test.dart` scans the
   real database file — extend it rather than writing a second one.
1b. **`pruneOrphanedSecrets()` runs after a successful keyring use** — the
   engine does it once a session after the first credentials read — never
   at launch on its own: listing a locked keyring prompts for its password.
2. **Sync writes go through the DAOs' `upsertAll` and `sweep`.** Upserts
   rewrite only provider-owned columns — never `display_name`, `is_hidden`,
   a category's `sort_order`, or `episodes_fetched_at`. If a new column is
   provider-owned, add it to that DAO's `DoUpdate` list, or re-syncs will
   silently keep the stale value.
3. **Mark-and-sweep uses the run id:** `SyncRunsDao.start()` returns the id,
   every upserted row carries it in `seen_run`, and only a *succeeded* run
   sweeps. Sweep the items before the categories. Call
   `SyncRunsDao.failInterrupted()` once on launch (`SyncService.startUp()`
   does, from `bootstrap()`).
4. Categories are unique per `(source_id, kind, remote_key)`; items per
   `(source_id, remote_key)`. `idsByRemoteKey(source, kind)` maps a
   provider's category id to the row id items need.
5. **Schema changes:** bump `schemaVersion`, `dart run build_runner build`,
   then `dart run drift_dev make-migrations` — one command writes the dump
   (`drift_schemas/app/`), `lib/data/db/app_database.steps.dart`, and
   `test/drift/app/generated/`. Write the `fromNToM` step in
   `AppDatabase`, and add a case to `test/drift/app/migration_test.dart`
   (ours; the tool leaves it alone once it exists). **Don't create triggers
   inside a step:** `_recreateTriggers` rebuilds them all after every
   upgrade, because drift's versioned schemas omit them and its verifier
   doesn't compare them.
6. FTS consistency in tests: `INSERT INTO <t>(<t>, rank) VALUES
   ('integrity-check', 1)` throws on a stale index (verified).
7. **`DoUpdate.withExcluded` inside `Batch.insertAll` needs explicit type
   arguments** (`DoUpdate<$ChannelsTable, ChannelRow>.withExcluded`), or the
   analyzer reports every `excluded.x` as a nullable access.
8. Root `flutter analyze` reaches into `tools/fake_provider`; `dart pub get`
   there first. Work in it with `dart test` from `tools/fake_provider`, and
   `dart run tools/fake_provider/bin/server.dart` from the repo root.
9. The ffmpeg tests need `third_party/ffmpeg/linux-x64/ffmpeg` and
   `tools/media_samples/out`, and skip with a reason without them. Keep it
   that way: CI on Windows has neither.
10. `/proc/<pid>` is a **directory**; liveness checks read
    `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`.
11. The shell's slots are filled by overriding their providers from the
    feature that owns the data: source, switcher, sync line and notice come
    from `sourceShellOverrides` (step 7); `shellDownloadsProvider` (Phase 8)
    and `shellCastSessionProvider` (Phase 7) are still empty.
12. `test/app/app_harness.dart`: `pumpApp(tester, overrides: [...])`,
    `findByLabel('…')`; don't call `pumpApp` twice in one test.
13. Re-recording a golden: `flutter test --tags golden --update-goldens`,
    then look at the PNG before trusting it.
14. Commit messages carry no trailers. Commit locally; the user pushes.
15. At the end: analyze, format check, `TZ=UTC flutter test`, the fake
    provider's `dart test`, each integration test under `xvfb-run -a … -d
    linux` (one file per run), add to ADR-011, update `docs/progress.md`,
    overwrite this file, and commit.

## Don't reopen without new evidence
- Phase 4 (ADR-011): the seven plan decisions; the swap on the app's side;
  seven v5 tables; the XMLTV parser as our own byte scanner (the `xml`
  package is dropped); entities decoded twice; `out_of_order` — the first
  schedule read wins; an import with nothing to keep fails and the old
  guide stays.
- Goldens are drawn at `goldenNow()`, a local time, never an instant: a
  screen formats times in the viewer's zone.
- Flutter + media_kit for desktop with the patched `media_kit_video` in
  `third_party/` (ADR-001, ADR-003). fvp only if Windows fails.
- Casting through our own Cast v2 client, the Default Media Receiver and a
  bundled FFmpeg relay (ADR-004). H.264 → HLS/TS; HEVC → one continuous
  fragmented MP4.
- Package choices in ADR-002; downloads and the local library are in v1
  (ADR-005); discovery is bonsoir with multicast_dns as the proven fallback
  (ADR-006). sqlite3_flutter_libs stays dropped — the FTS5 test proves the
  `sqlite3` package's binaries are enough.
- `DateTime` columns are ISO-8601 UTC **text**. drift's other option is unix
  seconds, which it reads back as local time, so a UTC value doesn't survive
  the round trip. EPG times stay integer epoch ms in their own columns.
- Goldens are recorded on Linux only (text rasterization differs on Windows),
  tagged `golden` at library level and declared in `dart_test.yaml`.
- `ChannelRow` draws the programme's progress as a 72 px bar **on the title
  line**, after an ellipsized title, as the canvas does. The bottom-edge
  version from step 3b struck through the title; don't put it back.
- The fake provider's quirks are split on purpose: value quirks are baked in
  by the generator (it knows the item's index), representation quirks by
  `JsonShape` at serialization.
- The fake provider's draws are index-addressable rather than a sequential
  `Random(seed)`: lazy generation means item N must not depend on N−1.
- Bad credentials: 200 with `{"user_info":{"auth":0}}` on `player_api.php`
  (what real panels send), 401 on a stream.
- The focus ring is stroked outside the control, not a box shadow, and it
  inverts to the primary text colour on accent-filled surfaces.
- `FocusPane` is a traversal group, not a `FocusScope`.
- Global shortcuts wrap the router's navigator, not the shell.
- Search is a route, not a dialog, so Ctrl+K, Esc and back agree.
- The canvas beats docs/05 on token values; docs/05 gets corrected at the end
  of the phase along with ADR-008.
- Categories are unique per kind; mark-and-sweep compares a run id, not a
  timestamp; FTS is maintained by triggers with a `WHEN` guard (ADR-009, with
  the measurements).
- Hand-written tolerant readers rather than json_serializable for provider
  data; no dio `receiveTimeout`; one request at a time per source; URLs
  always rebuilt from the source's server (ADR-009).
- Secrets only in the keyring, no file fallback; playlist and EPG URLs in
  the database as their origin only, not masked; orphan pruning after a
  sync, never at launch (ADR-009).
- The sync isolate connects straight to the database isolate
  (`serializableConnection()` over `createBackgroundConnection`), writes
  only in batches, and is killed on cancel; FTS triggers stay (sync costs
  ~75 µs a row with them, far inside the budget); dangling categories are
  a null `category_id`; an empty Xtream list keeps the last one (ADR-009).

- Onboarding (ADR-009 step 6): the sync page is reached with `go`, so Esc
  can't abandon a first sync; a source is added at Start sync, not at the
  test; the typed draft is kept in memory only; categories cluster over
  the whole list and the filter only hides entries.
- Settings (ADR-009 step 7): the overview query watches `sources` and
  `sync_runs` only; the current source is remembered, with the first as
  the fallback; Edit reuses Connect; the manager is a flat list; a
  destructive dialog focuses its safe button; in-field Clear is not a Tab
  stop.

## Open questions for the user
- The second Google TV doesn't answer on the network. Is it on another
  network, and should later casting tests include it?
- When the Windows PC is available for the Windows playback run.
- App name and icon (placeholder "IPTV Player").
- Light theme: tokens allow one, but it is out of scope for v1 (docs/05).
