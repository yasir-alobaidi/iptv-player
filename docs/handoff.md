# Handoff — 2026-09-19 (session 18, Phase 2 exit)

For the next Claude Code session on this project, and for the user starting it.

## Before you start the next session (user)
**Review Phase 2 and push.** Three local commits sit on top of what you
pushed: step 7, the real-provider test, and step 8. CI was red on your
last push (step 6: a stale generated hash); step 7 already fixes it, so
the push should go green.

Your provider login is in `~/.config/iptv-player-dev/real_provider.json`
(only you can read it; it is not in the repository). It has
`"wrong_password": false` so reruns don't add failed sign-ins. To rerun
the walk against your provider:

```
xvfb-run -a flutter test integration_test/real_provider_test.dart -d linux
cat build/real_provider_run/report.md
```

You shared the password in chat. If that worries you, change it with
your provider and update the file.

What I decided without asking (say if you want any changed):
- a 404 with an empty body from the panel means "Sign-in refused"
  (that is how your panel says it); a 404 with a page is "Not found";
- the Pick categories list is one Tab stop: arrows move inside it, Tab
  goes on to Back and Finish. The Settings Categories manager is not
  changed yet (nothing sits below its list; listed in Known issues).

## Start prompt
Open Claude Code in this folder and paste:

```
Continue the IPTV player project. Read docs/handoff.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/progress.md,
docs/08-phases-and-prompts.md (Phase 3) and ADR-009 in docs/decisions.md first.
Phase 2 is reviewed and pushed; CI is <green | red: …>.
Phase 3 plan: <approved as written | changes: …>. Start step 1.
```

## Where things stand
- **Phases 1 and 2 are complete** (ADR-008, ADR-009 Accepted). Phase 2's
  exit: the `large` sync in 7.7 s against a 60 s budget, every quirk
  fixture green, onboarding working against the fake provider and your
  real one (12,610 channels, 20,072 movies, 8,262 series in about 9 s).
- Profile mode, `large` sync on this laptop: worst frame build 7.1 ms, the
  UI isolate's longest pause 29 ms (budget 32).
- Your provider allows **1 connection** and it was in use by another
  device during the run. Phase 3's playback must handle that plainly.
- All checks clean: analyze, format, the app tests, the fake-provider
  tests, 4 integration tests (the real-provider one skips without the
  login file).

## Done this session (2026-09-19)
- `integration_test/real_provider_test.dart` (the keyboard walk against
  your panel) and its two fixes: the empty-404 sign-in refusal
  (`XtreamClient`, fake quirk `refusedSignInAs404`) and the one-Tab-stop
  category list (`FocusPane(tabStop: true)`).
- Step 8: `integration_test/large_sync_test.dart`, the profile-mode
  measurement via `flutter drive` (`test_driver/integration_test.dart`),
  the `withWeight()` cleanup (7 goldens re-recorded), docs/02, 05, 06,
  ADR-009 Accepted.

## Instructions for the next session
1. **Phase 3 plan is written** (`docs/plans/phase-3-live-tv-and-playback.md`), waiting for approval; start step 1 once approved, recording the answers in the plan's status line and in ADR-010.
   From the real panel: `max_connections` 1 and already in use; the
   account's `allowed_output_formats` is `m3u8, ts`; the live format
   defaults to TS.
1j. **Step 8:** keyboard helpers for integration tests live in
   `integration_test/support/keyboard.dart` (`Keys`, finders). They send
   explicit physical keys (profile builds have no key debug names) and
   `resume()` clears held keys (the real desktop reports its modifiers).
   A long list is one Tab stop with `FocusPane(tabStop: true)`. Frame
   times: `flutter drive --profile -d linux
   --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart
   --target=integration_test/large_sync_test.dart`; the Linux embedder
   reports raster time as 0. An empty 404 from the panel is an
   `AuthFailure`; a scripted test server that means "not found" must
   send a body.
1i. **Step 7 (Settings):** `SettingsScreen` + `settingsLocationProvider`
   (section, and the source the Categories section manages); open it from
   anywhere with `openSettings()`. Pages in
   `lib/features/sources/presentation/`: `SourcesSettings`,
   `CategoriesManager`, `source_text.dart` (every phrase about a source's
   state), `current_source.dart` (`chosenSourceIdProvider`,
   `currentSourceProvider` — what the catalogue screens of Phase 3+
   should browse), `source_shell_slots.dart` (`sourceShellOverrides`,
   applied in `bootstrap()`; an integration test must apply them too).
   Edit is `ConnectScreen(editSourceId:)` at `editSourcePath(id)`.
   `onboardingReturnPathProvider` makes adding from Settings end there.
   Remove a source only through `SyncService.removeSource()`, then
   `chosenSourceIdProvider.notifier.forget(id)`.
   **Show menus and dialogs with `showAppMenu` / `showAppDialog`**; Esc
   closes them through the global Esc action. A callback a provider builds
   must not use its `ref` later: read the notifiers first (see
   `source_shell_slots.dart`).
   **Integration tests under xvfb:** register `tester.testTextInput`,
   ignore the engine's lifecycle and view-focus events (there is no window
   manager, so the window flips between focused and not and Flutter parks
   keyboard focus), and send Enter in a text field as
   `receiveAction(TextInputAction.done)`, as the platform's text input
   does. **One file per `flutter test` run** on Linux desktop.
1h. **Onboarding (step 6):** screens in `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/`;
   the domain they use in `lib/features/sources/domain/` (`SourceChecker`,
   `CategoryRepository`, `validateDraft`, `groupCategories`). The app opens on
   Welcome when the sources table is empty (`startLocationProvider`, set in
   `bootstrap()`). Widget tests run against the fakes in
   `test/features/onboarding/onboarding_fakes.dart`; **a future a fake hands
   out must be made inside the test body**, not in `setUp`, or the fake clock
   never delivers it. `focusIsOn(tester, finder)` there checks keyboard focus.
   Set text weights with `TextStyle.withWeight()`, never
   `copyWith(fontWeight:)` alone (it doesn't change a variable font's weight;
   older components still do it, see Known issues). `layering_test.dart`
   fails when presentation or design code imports drift, dio, media_kit,
   sqlite3, `dart:io`, `dart:isolate` or `lib/data/`.
1g. **The sync engine (step 5):** the sync isolate writes **only single
   batches, never a transaction** — a killed isolate's open transaction
   blocks the database for everyone (spiked). Start and finish happen on
   the UI isolate; the finish is one transaction. `openAppDatabase` must
   stay a `createBackgroundConnection` (not a `LazyDatabase`), or sync
   writes go through a proxy on the UI isolate; `app_database_open_test`
   guards it. A closure sent to an isolate must be built in a top-level
   function (`startSyncJob`), or it drags its enclosing scope along.
   `removeSource()` stops a sync before removing its source; an empty Xtream
   list is swept only when the previous successful run had it empty too
   (`counts_json` `"empty"`). The kill test needs `dart` on PATH and is skipped on Windows.
1f. **M3U (step 4):** credentials in stream URLs are `{username}`,
   `{password}`, `{token}` placeholders; `fillUrl(template,
   playlistSecrets(realPlaylistUrl))` rebuilds the real URL at play time
   (Phase 3). The identity hash is pinned in tests: never change
   `entryIdentity`. Test fixtures are byte-exact (`.gitattributes`).
   Timing checks go in a test tagged `benchmark`, which is skipped unless
   run with `--tags benchmark --run-skipped`.
1c. **The Xtream client (step 3):** get credentials only through
   `SourceRepository.credentialsFor()`, and never keep `SourceCredentials`
   in a long-lived object. `XtreamAccount.toStoredJson()` is an allow-list
   and already free of the echoed username and password, so store exactly
   that in `account_json`. In step 5 the client runs **inside** the sync
   isolate. **Don't set dio's `receiveTimeout`** anywhere: it replaces a
   Timer per chunk and froze the UI isolate for ~1 s on 50k rows; the
   client's own idle watchdog (`idleTimeout`) replaces it.
1d. **Tests that talk to a real server** (the fake provider in-process, or
   a scripted `HttpServer`) need `setUpAll(() => HttpOverrides.global =
   null)`: flutter_test's binding otherwise answers every request with a
   400. **Timing and jank measurements need the fake provider in its own
   process** (`dart run tools/fake_provider/bin/server.dart --profile large
   --port …`): in-process, its JSON encoding shows up as the client's jank.
   To test a connection dropped mid-body, use a raw `ServerSocket`;
   `HttpServer.detachSocket()` leaves it open.
1e. **Write invisible characters as escapes** (`'\ufeff'`, `'\ufffd'`,
   `\u00a0`). The file-writing tool turned escapes into the literal
   characters more than once this session; grep for them before
   committing.
1a. **Secrets (step 2):** the keyring holds one JSON document per source
   under `source.<id>`; the database never holds a password, and holds
   playlist and EPG URLs as their origin only (`displayOrigin()`), because
   `redact()` can't see a token in a path. `InMemoryCredentialStore` (with
   `locked = true` to simulate a locked keyring) is the store for every
   test and CI; there is no keyring there. The hard-rule-3 test in
   `test/features/sources/data/db_source_repository_test.dart` scans the
   real database file — extend it rather than writing a second one.
1b. **`pruneOrphanedSecrets()` runs after a successful keyring use** — the
   engine does it once a session after the first credentials read — never
   at launch on its own: listing a locked keyring prompts for its password.
2. **Sync writes go through the DAOs' `upsertAll` and `sweep`.** Upserts
   rewrite only provider-owned columns — never `display_name`, `is_hidden`,
   a category's `sort_order`, or `episodes_fetched_at`. If a new column is
   provider-owned, add it to that DAO's `DoUpdate` list, or re-syncs will
   silently keep the stale value.
3. **Mark-and-sweep uses the run id:** `SyncRunsDao.start()` returns the id,
   every upserted row carries it in `seen_run`, and only a *succeeded* run
   sweeps. Sweep the items before the categories. Call
   `SyncRunsDao.failInterrupted()` once on launch (`SyncService.startUp()`
   does, from `bootstrap()`).
4. Categories are unique per `(source_id, kind, remote_key)`; items per
   `(source_id, remote_key)`. `idsByRemoteKey(source, kind)` maps a
   provider's category id to the row id items need.
5. **Schema changes:** bump `schemaVersion`, `dart run build_runner build`,
   then `dart run drift_dev make-migrations` — one command writes the dump
   (`drift_schemas/app/`), `lib/data/db/app_database.steps.dart`, and
   `test/drift/app/generated/`. Write the `fromNToM` step in
   `AppDatabase`, and add a case to `test/drift/app/migration_test.dart`
   (ours; the tool leaves it alone once it exists). **Don't create triggers
   inside a step:** `_recreateTriggers` rebuilds them all after every
   upgrade, because drift's versioned schemas omit them and its verifier
   doesn't compare them.
6. FTS consistency in tests: `INSERT INTO <t>(<t>, rank) VALUES
   ('integrity-check', 1)` throws on a stale index (verified).
7. **`DoUpdate.withExcluded` inside `Batch.insertAll` needs explicit type
   arguments** (`DoUpdate<$ChannelsTable, ChannelRow>.withExcluded`), or the
   analyzer reports every `excluded.x` as a nullable access.
8. Root `flutter analyze` reaches into `tools/fake_provider`; `dart pub get`
   there first. Work in it with `dart test` from `tools/fake_provider`, and
   `dart run tools/fake_provider/bin/server.dart` from the repo root.
9. The ffmpeg tests need `third_party/ffmpeg/linux-x64/ffmpeg` and
   `tools/media_samples/out`, and skip with a reason without them. Keep it
   that way: CI on Windows has neither.
10. `/proc/<pid>` is a **directory**; liveness checks read
    `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`.
11. The shell's slots are filled by overriding their providers from the
    feature that owns the data: source, switcher, sync line and notice come
    from `sourceShellOverrides` (step 7); `shellDownloadsProvider` (Phase 8)
    and `shellCastSessionProvider` (Phase 7) are still empty.
12. `test/app/app_harness.dart`: `pumpApp(tester, overrides: [...])`,
    `findByLabel('…')`; don't call `pumpApp` twice in one test.
13. Re-recording a golden: `flutter test --tags golden --update-goldens`,
    then look at the PNG before trusting it.
14. Commit messages carry no trailers. Commit locally; the user pushes.
15. At the end: analyze, format check, `flutter test`, the fake provider's
    `dart test`, each integration test under `xvfb-run -a … -d linux` (one
    file per run), add to ADR-009, update `docs/progress.md`, overwrite
    this file, and commit.

## Don't reopen without new evidence
- Flutter + media_kit for desktop with the patched `media_kit_video` in
  `third_party/` (ADR-001, ADR-003). fvp only if Windows fails.
- Casting through our own Cast v2 client, the Default Media Receiver and a
  bundled FFmpeg relay (ADR-004). H.264 → HLS/TS; HEVC → one continuous
  fragmented MP4.
- Package choices in ADR-002; downloads and the local library are in v1
  (ADR-005); discovery is bonsoir with multicast_dns as the proven fallback
  (ADR-006). sqlite3_flutter_libs stays dropped — the FTS5 test proves the
  `sqlite3` package's binaries are enough.
- `DateTime` columns are ISO-8601 UTC **text**. drift's other option is unix
  seconds, which it reads back as local time, so a UTC value doesn't survive
  the round trip. EPG times stay integer epoch ms in their own columns.
- Goldens are recorded on Linux only (text rasterization differs on Windows),
  tagged `golden` at library level and declared in `dart_test.yaml`.
- `ChannelRow` draws the programme's progress as a 72 px bar **on the title
  line**, after an ellipsized title, as the canvas does. The bottom-edge
  version from step 3b struck through the title; don't put it back.
- The fake provider's quirks are split on purpose: value quirks are baked in
  by the generator (it knows the item's index), representation quirks by
  `JsonShape` at serialization.
- The fake provider's draws are index-addressable rather than a sequential
  `Random(seed)`: lazy generation means item N must not depend on N−1.
- Bad credentials: 200 with `{"user_info":{"auth":0}}` on `player_api.php`
  (what real panels send), 401 on a stream.
- The focus ring is stroked outside the control, not a box shadow, and it
  inverts to the primary text colour on accent-filled surfaces.
- `FocusPane` is a traversal group, not a `FocusScope`.
- Global shortcuts wrap the router's navigator, not the shell.
- Search is a route, not a dialog, so Ctrl+K, Esc and back agree.
- The canvas beats docs/05 on token values; docs/05 gets corrected at the end
  of the phase along with ADR-008.
- Categories are unique per kind; mark-and-sweep compares a run id, not a
  timestamp; FTS is maintained by triggers with a `WHEN` guard (ADR-009, with
  the measurements).
- Hand-written tolerant readers rather than json_serializable for provider
  data; no dio `receiveTimeout`; one request at a time per source; URLs
  always rebuilt from the source's server (ADR-009).
- Secrets only in the keyring, no file fallback; playlist and EPG URLs in
  the database as their origin only, not masked; orphan pruning after a
  sync, never at launch (ADR-009).
- The sync isolate connects straight to the database isolate
  (`serializableConnection()` over `createBackgroundConnection`), writes
  only in batches, and is killed on cancel; FTS triggers stay (sync costs
  ~75 µs a row with them, far inside the budget); dangling categories are
  a null `category_id`; an empty Xtream list keeps the last one (ADR-009).

- Onboarding (ADR-009 step 6): the sync page is reached with `go`, so Esc
  can't abandon a first sync; a source is added at Start sync, not at the
  test; the typed draft is kept in memory only; categories cluster over
  the whole list and the filter only hides entries.
- Settings (ADR-009 step 7): the overview query watches `sources` and
  `sync_runs` only; the current source is remembered, with the first as
  the fallback; Edit reuses Connect; the manager is a flat list; a
  destructive dialog focuses its safe button; in-field Clear is not a Tab
  stop.

## Open questions for the user
- The second Google TV doesn't answer on the network. Is it on another
  network, and should later casting tests include it?
- When the Windows PC is available for the Windows playback run.
- App name and icon (placeholder "IPTV Player").
- Light theme: tokens allow one, but it is out of scope for v1 (docs/05).
